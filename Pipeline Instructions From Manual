6.7 PIIC Pipeline - Written by Alice Heranval
6.7.1 Potential Method for Installation
Note: Installation must be on device with x86 64 architecture. Linux virtual machines installed on
Mac (arm64) architecture will have similar architectures which cannot run PIIC. Emulation was
attempted with Linux on UTM, but ultimately was too slow for data reduction.
Steps
• download PIIC file (from online, gildas download area, https://www.iram.fr/ gildas/dist/index.html)
– piic-exe-jun23a.tar.xz
∗ or latest version
– piic-dafs-feb23a.tar.xz (optional- make sure latest dafs version is located in the dafs
folder once piic-exe is unzipped
• unzip (command tar xf filename when in Downloads directory)
• in main directory, customize bash profile:
– echo export GAG ROOT DIR=<installpath>/piic-exe-dec22a >> /.bash profile
– echo export GAG EXEC SYSTEM=x86 64-generic >> /.bash profile
– echo source $GAG ROOT DIR/etc/bash profile >> /.bash profile
∗ creates bash profile and appends commands to it
***found a method that works to add everything (did not initially understand
which /.bash profile to customize***
• download files from online, unzip, take note of install path <installpath>
6.7. PIIC PIPELINE 47
• echo export GAG ROOT DIR=<installpath>/piic-exe-dec22a >> <installpath>/piic-exe-dec22a/
etc/bash profile
• echo export GAG EXEC SYSTEM=x86 64-generic >> <installpath>/piic-exe-dec22a/etc/bash
profile
• source $GAG ROOT DIR/etc/bash profile
– reloads bash profile with changes
• run! with command piic
– note: did not get past this as my computer did not run piic natively
6.7.2 Running on IRAM server
Running PIIC
• ssh into online server: ssh 032-22@mrt-enter.iram.es
– type in password
• ssh into running environment: ssh mrt-lx5
• go to working directory (in this case, working directory should already be set up within
PIIC RED or within test directory)
• use command gagpiic to set up environment variables (will not work otherwise)
• then use command piic to run!
– list of .fits files will be listed, simply type ”c” and hit enter to run. Wait for the magic
to happen!
– resulting .fits files will be located in directory entitled red.
Basic Setup
Before running PIIC, make sure you have your working directory set up with the necessary .LIST
file (where all the .fits files to use are listed), a symbolic link to the data (.fits files) directory
(imbfitsDir) and your png, red, stat directories, where output of data processing will be lo-
cated. If not, make sure you set up the symbolic link and use command mkdir png red stat to
get those set up. See the next section for how to create .LIST files.
Some basic steps to follow:
mkdir my working dir !if you do not yet have a working directory
cd my working dir/
mkdir png red stat
ln -s directory containing data imbfitsDir

Setting up .LIST files
In order to set up your .LIST files for use with PIIC, simply go to your working directory and from
there into the imbfitsDir. Then, simply use the ls command to move all needed files into your
list. For example, the following command creates a .LIST file of all files in the NIKA2 band:
ls iram-30m*-2-* > <path to working dir>/my working dir/all ar2.LIST
There are some (very rudimentary) Python codes to facilitate creation of command line arguments
to select the correct files for sources, located at https://github.com/aheranval/reu code 2023. All
they require is to download the .csv of observation information from tapas website at https://tapas.iram.es,
simply go to My Projects, click on the project ID, go to all scans, select the maximum number of
rows per page, and select .csv under format. You can save it from there.
Making .piic file to run
To create your actual .piic file, you can simply copy a template to your working directory, edit
it using the nano command, and save it with your desired title. The only things to add to your
template are:
• Select the nikaBand variable (use ”1”, ”2”, ”3” or ”13”)
• Select your list using the inList variable (inList "J1510 ar"’nikaBand’ is one example
with the selected file being J1510 ar2 with the nikaBand variable set to 2)
• Set hpbwToUse variable for the half-power beam width of the telescope, used for other calcu-
lations within the reduction. According to the PIIC Pipelines documentation, HPBW is 11
arcseconds for 1mm observations and 17 arcseconds for 2mm observations, so just type 11 for
1mm and 17 for 2mm
