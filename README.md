Some simple Python code for putting together command line arguments to make .LIST files for use in data reduction. VERY simple - not reflective of my coding ability.
For use by future people running PIIC pipeline to reduce data from NIKA2 30m telescope. Referenced in instructions of Overleaf project, designed simply to reduce need for extra steps.
Results of commandLineMaker.py are printed, not returned, simply copy paste the printed line to command line **while within directory containing data** in order to create .LIST file for use with PIIC reduction.
